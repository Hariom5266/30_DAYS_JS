// üçµ, Hanji Kaise ho aap sabhi ,This is 17th day of JS Challenge.I‚Äôm back and ready to code,Let's roll the code!
// # ================================= DATA STRUCTURES ================================= #

// # ================================= ACTIVITY 1: Linked List ================================= #

// Implement a Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties value and next.

//Implement a LinkedList class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.

// # ================================= ACTIVITY 2: Stack ================================= #

//Implement a Stack class with methods push (add element), pop (remove element), and peak(view the first element).

//Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping then off.

// # ================================= ACTIVITY 3: Queue ================================= #

//Implement a Queue class with methods qnqueue {add element}, dequeue {remove element}, and front {view the first element}.

//Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where printjobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

// # ================================= ACTIVITY 4: Binary Tree ================================= #

//Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left, and right.

//Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display node.

// # ================================= ACTIVITY 5: Graph ================================= #

//Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).


//Use the Graph class to reperesent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.
